          <div>
            <br />I'm a current 6th year doctoral student at the University of Oregon. I took a unique path<br />to pursuing a PhD in psychology. As an undergraduate, I began with studying astrophysics<br />at the University of Colorado. As a Texas native, it was thrilling to be surrounded<br />by snow and mountains for the first time. But alas, for financial reasons, I returned <br />to my home state and finished my bachelor's degree at the University of North Texas. <br />Because UNT had no astrophysics program, I completed my undergraduate degree in <br />chemistry. However, I didn't feel satisfied with only studying the elementary components <br />which make up all objects in the universe. Instead, I felt compelled to study some of the <br />objects that these elements combine interestingly and complexly into: people. <br />After finishing my bachelor's degree, I set my sights on pursuing a graduate degree in <br />psychology and received a master's in social psychology from San Francisco State University. <br /><br />I've spent the last eight years being trained in the methods of understanding real-world<br />phenomena through empirical observation and analysis. This has included taking courses in <br />statistical and research methods, applying these techniques to my own independent research <br />projects, and teaching these skills of conducting research to other undergraduate and graduate <br />students.<br /><br /><font size = "5"><b>Current Interests & Projects</b></font><br /><br />The area of psychology research I have always been most fascniated with is cultural psychology. <br />Specifically, I'm interested in understanding the ways in which culture has an influence on <br />people's thoughts and behaviors and the mechanisms via which these effects happen. Additionally, <br />I'm very interested and concerned with environmental issues like climate change. In my current <br />project, I'm applying a combination of these interests to understand how psychological <br />understandings of the influence of culture on people can be applied to mitigate individuals' <br />impacts on ongoing climate change processes.<br /><br />In my current project, I'm investigating how norm interventions can best be applied to reduce<br />the environmentally impactful behavior of unsustinable consumption. Unsustainable consumption <br />is the consumption of goods and services with negative environmental impacts at levels not <br />sustainable long-term by the planet. Previous work has found that norms, which are preceived <br />rules for behavior that exist among groups of people, can have profound impacts on people's<br />behavior, making them a good candidate for an intervention tool in the domain of environmentally<br />relevant behaviors.<br /><br /><br /><font size = "5"><b>Critique of Current Scientific Practices</b></font><br /><br />Another area which I'm intensely interested in is the critique of current scientific practices <br />and how normative practices may be doing a disservice to the project of scientifically<br />understanding psychological phenomena. I'm interested in pursuing the normalization of better <br />scientific practices to strengthen our field's body of literature and the confidence we can <br />have in our published findings. <br /><br />Changing current scientific practices for the better includes the normalization of behaviors<br />such as joining the open science movement, pre-registration, and updating the norms <br />around publication practices. <br /><br /><br /><font size = "5"><b>Education:</b></font><br />-- <b>PhD</b> in Social Psychology, University of Oregon (expected Summer 2023)<br />-- <b>M.A.</b> in Social Psychology, San Francisco State University, 2016<br />

        high-energy objects that existed in the early universe.

        There is a peculiar phenomenon identified in sociology called
        &#39;unpopular norms&#39;, which are norms that guide the everyday
        behavior of members of a group that secretly the group members
        actually disagree with. In this project, I investigated unpopular
        norms that exist among college students.

        Display rules are informal rules that exist among cultural groups regarding
        how acceptable it is for individuals to express different types of emotions.
        In this study, I investigated the relative importance of individual-level traits,
        specifically personality, and cultural-level factors, display rules, for 
        predicting peoples&#39; expression of different emotions.

        This study investigated whether differences in how one expresses one emotions to 
        close others, such as one&#39;s parents, versus distant others, such as strangers,
        could be explained by how much individuals value collectivism, which is a value
        emphasizing the importance of relational harmony.
