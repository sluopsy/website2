title = "About Me"

text = """
I'm a current doctoral student at the University of Oregon that loves using data analysis 
to understand the world. I have been teaching statistics and data analysis for seven years.

I'm also a psychology researcher interested in how norm interventions can be used to 
reduce peoples' unsustainable consumption, which is the consumption of goods and services 
with negative environmental impacts at levels not sustainable long-term by the planet. 

<b>Education:</b>
-- PhD in Social Psychology, University of Oregon (expected Summer 2022)
-- M.A. in Social Psychology, San Francisco State University, 2016
