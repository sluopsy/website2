title = "About Me"

text = """
I'm a current doctoral student at the University of Oregon. I enjoy using data analysis 
as a tool to understand the world. I have been teaching statistics and data analysis 
for seven years.

I'm also a psychology researcher interested in many different topics, including norms,
unsustainable consumption, and shared reality. 

Currently, I'm working on a project investigating how norm interventions can be used 
to reduce peoples' unsustainable consumption, which is the consumption of goods and 
services with negative environmental impacts at levels not sustainable long-term 
by the planet. 

I'm also very interested in the critique of current scientific practices and how we,
as a scientific community, can make improvements to strengthen our field's body of 
literature. This includes joining the open science movement, normalizing 
pre-registration, and updating the norms around publication practices. 


<b>Education:</b>
-- PhD in Social Psychology, University of Oregon (expected Summer 2022)
-- M.A. in Social Psychology, San Francisco State University, 2016
