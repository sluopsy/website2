text = """
I'm a current 6th year doctoral student at the University of Oregon. I took a unique path
to pursuing a PhD in psychology. As an undergraduate, I began with studying astrophysics
at the University of Colorado. As a Texas native, it was thrilling to be surrounded
by snow and mountains for the first time. But alas, for financial reasons, I returned 
to my home state and finished my bachelor's degree at the University of North Texas. 
Because UNT had no astrophysics program, I completed my undergraduate degree in 
chemistry. However, I didn't feel satisfied with only studying the elementary components 
which make up all objects in the universe. Instead, I felt compelled to study some of the 
objects that these elements combine interestingly and complexly into: people. 
After finishing my bachelor's degree, I set my sights on pursuing a graduate degree in 
psychology and received a master's in social psychology from San Francisco State University. 

I've spent the last eight years being trained in the methods of understanding real-world
phenomena through empirical observation and analysis. This has included taking courses in 
statistical and research methods, applying these techniques to my own independent research 
projects, and teaching these skills of conducting research to other undergraduate and graduate 
students.

<font size = "5"><b>Current Interests & Projects</b></font>

The area of psychology research I have always been most fascniated with is cultural psychology. 
Specifically, I'm interested in understanding the ways in which culture has an influence on 
people's thoughts and behaviors and the mechanisms via which these effects happen. Additionally, 
I'm very interested and concerned with environmental issues like climate change. In my current 
project, I'm applying a combination of these interests to understand how psychological 
understandings of the influence of culture on people can be applied to mitigate individuals' 
impacts on ongoing climate change processes.

In my current project, I'm investigating how norm interventions can best be applied to reduce
the environmentally impactful behavior of unsustinable consumption. Unsustainable consumption 
is the consumption of goods and services with negative environmental impacts at levels not 
sustainable long-term by the planet. Previous work has found that norms, which are preceived 
rules for behavior that exist among groups of people, can have profound impacts on people's
behavior, making them a good candidate for an intervention tool in the domain of environmentally
relevant behaviors.


<font size = "5"><b>Critique of Current Scientific Practices</b></font>

Another area which I'm intensely interested in is the critique of current scientific practices 
and how normative practices may be doing a disservice to the project of scientifically
understanding psychological phenomena. I'm interested in pursuing the normalization of better 
scientific practices to strengthen our field's body of literature and the confidence we can 
have in our published findings. 

Changing current scientific practices for the better includes the normalization of behaviors
such as joining the open science movement, pre-registration, and updating the norms 
around publication practices.
