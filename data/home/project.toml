        I co-created a tutorial on machine learning. Machine learning is a process for
        building predictive models. They have the unique feature of being built using 
        a 'training set' and tested using a 'holdout sample' to test the model's performance.

        There is a peculiar phenomenon identified in sociology called
        'unpopular norms', which are norms that guide the everyday
        behavior of members of a group that secretly the group members
        actually disagree with. In this project, I investigated unpopular
        norms that exist among college students.
